# Deconstruction-of-energy-consumption-by-LMDI
Using LMDI to deconstruct China's energy consumption(2010-2019)

A multiplicative form of the LMDI model(Logarithmic Mean Index Method, LMDI) is used to decompose the factors influencing China's carbon emissions in the past decade into: Economic Growth, Energy Mix Change, and Energy Efficiency Improvement, and to quantitatively explain the degree of influence of the three on the change of total carbon emissions in the decade.
The results find that economic growth has the greatest weight in influencing the change of China's carbon emissions in the past decade; energy structure has a greater potential for improving China's carbon emissions.
